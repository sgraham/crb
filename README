crb
---

(for "ChRomium Base")

A script to pull Chromium's base library and set it up to build outside of
Chromium.

Pulls a specific revision, munges the source a bit, and builds a debug and
release library.

Builds crb_debug.lib and crb_release.lib. One of those should be linked
against, and the parent of the created crb/ directory added to the include
path.

At some point, a --target= command line option should be added to package just
the headers, libs, and license files to a particular clean target directory.

Currently, only works on Windows. Pull requests welcome.
